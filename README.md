# Problem Statement

"By conducting a cartographic comparison of the transport infrastructure1 in two dissimilar cities utilizing space-time cubes2 and the cities’ transport index3, this study aims to identify gaps in the multimodal transport systems4 and propose simple strategies for improving navigation in the cities."  

# Abstract

The comparison of navigation patterns among different cities is an intriguing topic, particularly in exploring how the multimodal transport system of one city may inform the development of another (Zhang, et al., 2019). By using data visualizations such as space-time cubes and interactive maps, this study aims to understand the transport infrastructure in two dissimilar cities, compare time and space between them and, identify the gaps5 in the time and the routes, and their impact on urban structure. 

 The goal of this study is to visualize the differences in the transport systems6 based on two major criteria: the time it takes to cover the space it spreads in and understand how the cities are built for multimodal transport systems to be effectively incorporated. 

This research also tries to highlight the importance of maps as a tool for understanding urban infrastructure and identifying areas for improvement in transport systems, and to devise simple strategies that can help improve transportation in both cities, which can contribute to better urban development. 

# Objective

In this research, the aim is to explore the use of cartographic design to visually represent transportation, navigation systems and its challenges in a way that is engaging, aesthetic and easy to understand. While the topic of urban infrastructure is broad, the goal is to focus on key concepts and present them in a simplified manner. By doing so, we hope to create opportunities for further research and facilitate the development of more effective public and private transportation infrastructure, particularly in smaller cities. This approach could have significant implications for policymaking, particularly for key stakeholders with limited knowledge of navigation infrastructure (Bertolini et al., 2015).

- The primary objective of the research project is to develop a space-time cube environment with the linked map visualizations that can compare the transport systems of two cities, and highlight the similarities and differences between them. This will enable a better understanding of the potential variations in the current transport structure and identify new modes of transport that could be introduced in a seamless manner.

- To achieve this objective, a comparative web map of different map data visualizations will be created, showcasing the time and space dimensions of the two cities and how different transport systems function for the same distance. The data visualizations will be designed in an interactive manner, which will allow users to explore and manipulate the visualization for a better understanding of the data. 

## Why is it important?

Maps are an essential tool for analysing traffic, public transport infrastructure7, and urban planning (Mehaffy & Porta, 2020). By comparing the transport systems of two dissimilar cities and identifying the variations in their infrastructure, in the transport network like lack of public transport, or lack of connectivity in certain areas, and the time difference taken to commute the same distance in different peak hours, it is possible to highlight areas for potential improvement. 

The study seeks to understand the commonalities that exist between two vastly different cities, and how those commonalities can be used to address the challenges posed by multi-modal transport. The aim is to utilize cartographic and design techniques to understand the gaps in the transport of these cities, and to identify the factors that differentiate them. 

Ultimately, this research aims to contribute to the development of strategies that can be used to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of multimodal transport systems in both cities, and shed light on how maps can help with that study. Previous studies have also highlighted the importance of cartography and data visualization in analysing transport systems and urban planning (Cao & Li, 2021; Scheurer & Curtis, 2018).

## Data: 

The data is a combination of the metro/urban rail systems, with buses and other modes of transport used in each of these cities and the datasets are going to be taken from: 
- Bengaluru: BMTC,  Namma Metro, DULT (Transport Index) 
- Amsterdam: GVB 
- Field Work: Manually checking the routes provided on various map providers like Google, OpenStreetMap, to check the time taken from commuting between two points of origin and destination. 

Collecting data from several users in Bengaluru and Amsterdam using everyday modes of transport and considering the time they take for each leg of travel. 
This field work is an important step to first understand the layout of the transport systems personally and then updating the workflow for the data collection according to the findings from the first 15 routes checked for each city.

## Why these two cities? 

 The choice of cities for comparison is an important aspect of this research. Navigation is one of the primary applications of cartography (Kuhn, 2019), and understanding navigation patterns can inform policy changes and infrastructure improvements for cities. European cities have historically influenced the structure and development of cities in India, particularly in terms of urban transport systems (Basu et al., 2018). 
European cities are often considered good examples of well-integrated transport systems, which can serve as a benchmark for Indian cities. Comparing a European city with an Indian city can help identify why certain methods are more effective than others and can inform strategies to make Indian cities more public transport-friendly and reduce reliance on private vehicles. 
This research is on two specific cities of Bengaluru, India and Amsterdam, Netherlands. Since this is a multimodal transport comparison, these two cities were chosen, because Amsterdam has all modes of transport - metro, trams, buses, ferries, suburban rail, and bicycles used regularly and Bengaluru is now in the process of making the city more multimodal and less reliant on private transport and comparing these two cities will give a clear understanding of where cities like Bengaluru, Delhi, Mumbai or other Indian cities chosen for smart cities program, can be benefited with this research. 

## Understanding Gaps

   Navigation has been an intrinsic part of our daily lives, and commuters ask for efficient methods that will allow them to reach their destinations faster through highly developed transport network. (Abdelfattah et al., 2017) When it comes to improving the city’s transport network, public transport gets a huge importance because improving the public transport system improves the whole city’s infrastructure. 

But sometimes, certain areas do not have necessary footfall to build a whole new station or an underground line and certain transport methods like private cars or autorickshaws (in case of India) and bicycles (majorly Amsterdam) come into play. Analysing the multimodal transport system for improvement requires the understanding of the gaps, like: 

- Lack of integration between different modes of transport, such as buses, trains, and metros.
- Poor last-mile connectivity8, making it difficult for commuters to reach their final destinations from transport hubs.
- Insufficient infrastructure for pedestrians and cyclists, making it dangerous and difficult for them to navigate city roads.
- Limited accessibility9 for people with disabilities, with many public transport systems lacking appropriate facilities.
- Lack of real-time information about transport schedules and delays, which makes it difficult for commuters to plan their journeys.
- Public transport can be crowded and delays can occur due to maintenance or unexpected events.
- The narrow streets and historic architecture in cities like Amsterdam can create challenges for accommodating large vehicles such as buses or trucks.

# Ideology and Reasoning: 

The idea behind this research is to incorporate ease of understanding of transport navigation and enhancing navigation data visualization to make it more accessible and understandable to users, focusing on the elements of map design. This approach aligns with the principles of intuitive design10, which emphasizes the importance of designing for users' needs and experiences (Norman, 2013). While urban infrastructure is a vast concept, and the research cannot encompass every aspect of urban planning for multimodal transport infrastructure, understanding the core concepts and visualizing them in an accessible way might help pave the way for further research opportunities and contribute to the development of more effective public and private transport framework (Zhang et al., 2021).

The research aims to compare the transport systems of Amsterdam and Bengaluru and understand how to effectively modify and apply transport modes from one city to another. The project will incorporate cartographic and design elements such as maps and data visualizations to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each city's transport system. 

The project will explore using data from different city models to generate new ideas for integrating and building transport systems. Interactive data visualizations will be used to present complex data and to inform urban planning and development. 

The ultimate goal is to extend the opportunity to learn more on this topic and use these insights, particularly for smaller cities.

## Why spacetime cube? 

There are several techniques used for mapping and visualizing spatio-temporal data of navigation systems like:
- Spacetime Cubes: Visualizing the space-time relationship in a 3 dimension cube.
- Heat Maps: Visualizing the data using colours and intensity  
- Flow Maps: Understanding the flow or the direction of how the network or the traffic is moving.
- Animated Maps: A visualization that shows changes in transport behaviour over time through animations.
- Interactive Maps:  A map that allows the users to interact with and manipulate the data. 

For this research, the chosen methods to visualize the data are space-time cubes and interactive maps. Spacetime cube is a powerful tool for analysing and visualizing spatio-temporal data, enabling time-series analysis, integrated spatial and temporal pattern analysis, and 2D and 3D visualization techniques (Miller and Han, 2008). 

The ability to represent data in a spacetime cube is more useful in understanding the complex relationship between time and space, than the other methods listed, which is critical in the analysis of urban transport systems. This approach has been shown to be effective in identifying patterns and trends in spatio-temporal data (Bhaduri et al., 2002).

Using spacetime cube is critical to visualize how the cities are structured in all the dimensions for a proper comparison, which can aid in the development of strategies for improving transport systems and addressing issues related to space, accessibility and mobility (Chen et al., 2020).

By creating space-time cubes, it is possible to visualize how the spatio-temporal data11 changes in relation to other elements, which can provide a more detailed understanding of the cities and their transport systems. This combines with an interactive map using JavaScript that allows the users to interact with the space-time cube for a deeper understanding of the data. 

## Research Questions

This research aims to address several key questions that help map the transport infrastructure and its challenges:
- How might data visualizations such as space-time cubes be used to compare and map the transport infrastructure of two cities? 
  - What insights might be gained from this analysis for both cartography and transport?
- How can space-time cubes be used to identify differences in urban infrastructure, such as traffic delays, travel times, and transportation accessibility, last mile connectivity? 
  - What implications do these differences have for each city's transport system?
- To what extent these gaps (explained in the Gaps section) exist in cities of India like Bengaluru, and also to what extent the changes in the systems still persist in more developed cities like Amsterdam? 
- What are the impacts evident in the multimodal transport systems of the two cities under study, and how might these be related to the urban structure of each city? 
- How do time and space factors differ between the two cities, and what implications might these differences have for the design and improvement of transport systems?
- How can comparative analysis of transport systems between cities be used to assess potential for improvement of those cities? 
  - What factors are likely to influence success in implementing changes?
- What further research is needed to address any outstanding questions or issues that arise from this analysis?
- Finally, can we use one city's navigation system to help build or improve another city's transport network? 
  - To what extent can we implement one city’s ideas on another city’s developments, and will they work? 

## Methodology 

The methodology and the project set up explains how the research questions are set up to be answered and understood. 
- To conduct a literature review on cartographic techniques and their application in analysing transport systems. (Pertaining to the research question 1)
- To collect data on the transport infrastructure of both cities: different routes using different modes of transport, and the time taken to complete the routes. (Pertaining to the research questions 2&3)
- Create a space-time cubes, and the other required data maps to visualize and compare the route data. (Pertaining to the research question 3)
- Identify the temporal and spatial patterns of the transport systems of both cities and highlight the gaps and opportunities for improvement using the visualizations. (Pertaining to the research question 4)
- Analyse the insights gained from the comparison of the two cities and understanding the spread of the cities. (Pertaining to the research question 3&5)
- To enhance the data visualizations by incorporating design elements to create a comparative study. This study will showcase the different transport patterns of the two cities and identify areas where one city can benefit from the other. (Pertaining to the research question 3,5&6)
- To contribute to the existing literature on cartographic techniques and their application in transport systems analysis, and provide insights for the improvement of transport systems in India and other similar contexts. (Pertaining to the research question 6)

## Project Set up: 

The first part of the research is the field work: locally collecting data, that aims to select around 15 different routes using different transport methods to calculate how much travel distance can be covered in different time intervals - 15 mins, 30 mins, 45 mins, 1 hour, 1 and ½ hours, and 2 hours. 15 routes of each city, spanning over various distances and various time periods, to start with the comparison.

 Collecting more data points may result in more detailed analysis, but starting with fifteen routes per city for various time intervals provides a solid foundation for the initial comparison and understanding how the multimodal system is structured for the preliminary analysis before a more robust workflow is updated with more datasets. 
Collecting fifteen routes for each city is a reasonable and efficient approach to conducting this initial research. 15 is often used as a sample size in research because it is large enough to capture the overall picture of the system while being small enough to be manageable in terms of time and resources (Creswell, 2013), and can provide a diverse representation of the transport infrastructure, identify trends and patterns, and allow for comparisons between different cities and modes of transportation. 
This initial data collection will cover all major transport hubs and peak routes, and further data will be collected based on the initial readings.

Comparison of these routes for both the cities will highlight the bottlenecks in the transport systems, like why there is a time delay to cover the same distance: is it traffic, lack of better transport options, or missing links or last mile connectivity. 
This part of the research findings is then further used to interpret the gaps of the transport system, why there are certain elements of navigation missing or wrong, and identify what mode of transport works better and why, which leads to the final analysis listed. 

Analysing if there are any discontinuities or breaks in the transport system of Amsterdam.  This analysis will help identify methods that can be used to improve the mobility in Bengaluru, India that can further be translated to several other cities across India like Chennai, Mumbai, Kanpur, Delhi, Mangalore, Kolkata etc. Most of the cities are already considered for smart cities program12, and this research aims to understand how effectively can that be done using simple changes to the already existing transport mechanism. 


## Resources Required: 

This research project will require several resources to be successful. Firstly, it will require the use of a web mapping library such as D3.js to build the comparative data visualizations web map. This library will allow for the creation of interactive and visually appealing visualizations of the spatial and temporal data.
Secondly, fieldwork will be necessary to gather data about the transport systems of both cities. This may include surveys, interviews, and observational studies of the transport systems. The data collected will provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each city's transport system, and identify areas for potential improvement.
Thirdly, access to transportation data for both cities will be necessary to create the space-time cube and comparative data visualizations web map. This may include data on public transit routes, bike lanes, traffic patterns, and other relevant data.
In addition, software such as Adobe Illustrator or other vector graphics software may be necessary to create the data visualizations strips and the final poster.
Overall, this research project will require a combination of technical and fieldwork skills, as well as access to relevant data and software.

## Outcome: 

The research project aims to create an interactive web map using JavaScript and D3.JS and a poster that summarizes the findings of the data visualizations strip. The web map (will be added on Github as the study progresses) will interact with the user and displays the space-time cube and the explanations of the differences in the two cities’ navigation systems, and the poster will highlight the natural differences between the two cities and their common ground with respect to transport mobility seen on the map. By using innovative visualization techniques, the research project seeks to provide insights into how transport systems can be better designed and implemented for effective urban planning13 and development.

### References: 

The ongoing literature review is a vital component of this research project, as it provides a foundation for identifying and building upon previous works related to navigation comparison. Specifically, the review seeks to identify and synthesize works that explore the use of cartographic design in visually representing transportation navigation and its challenges. 

Although the review is ongoing, it is worth noting that thus far, there has been no direct comparison of an Indian city with a European city in this particular context, even though there have been comparisons of Indian cities with European cities for bicycle usages(Biswas et al., 2019). This research aims to bridge this gap by exploring the specific challenges and opportunities in urban planning for multi-modal transportation infrastructure in the two cities of Amsterdam and Bengaluru.
